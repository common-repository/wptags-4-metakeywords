This is a tiny, lightweight plugin I wrote to use the new native tagging from WordPress 2.3+ to automatically create a meta-keyword-tag for my blog. 

== Description ==

The plugin adds a meta-tag to the html-header-part of your blog. This meta-tag contains keywords that describe the contents of the html-page. Adding this kind of meta-tag is one part of the job of optimizing your blog for search engines. To learn more about search engine optimization, I recommend reading and understanding these articles:

* [about SEO at devlounge](http://www.devlounge.net/articles/plugins-for-a-search-engine-friendly-wordpress-blog "About SEO at devlounge.net")

== Installation ==

Just download the zip-archive, extract the plugin-file and upload it to 

* `/wp-contents/plugins/wptags-4-metakeywords`.

Then go to the plugin-admin-section of your blog and press activate. Now go to the options section and click on ‘WPtags 4 MetaKeywords’. There, you can enter some default-keywords, that are used on pages, where the plugin cannot determine automatically, which keywords to choose.
